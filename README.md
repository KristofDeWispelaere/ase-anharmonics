# ase-anharmonics
Uncoupled mode analysis for [ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) that goes beyond the harmonic approach and calculates the theremodynamics for rotational modes and frustrated vibrations. The module is a work in progress, which is made public to allow for open collaboration. 

The module was initially developed by Keld T. Lundgaard under guidance by Thomas Bligaard, who wrote the original 1d eigensolver methods. 
Current development by Keld T. Lundgaard
