# ASE-anharmonics
Uncoupled mode analysis for [ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) that goes beyond the harmonic approach and calculates the theremodynamics for rotational, translational and frustrated vibrational modes. 

## Details 

The current module allows the user to define and sample rotational modes and normal modes, and solve the 1D-schrodinger equation for these. The harmonic and anharmonic treatment is combined in the thermodynamical summary. 

See the examples folder for how to use. 

## Development

The module was initially developed by Keld T. Lundgaard under guidance by Thomas Bligaard, who wrote the original 1d eigensolver methods. 

Current development by Keld T. Lundgaard.
